# DOMinateJS

This is a custom JavaScript DOM manipulation library. I've been slowly chipping away at it when bored, but there's still quite a few functions I'd like to add before calling it "usable".

If you want to see completed projects with pretty READMEs, check out some of my other GitHub repositories, like [JSequencer](https://github.com/Eden12345/JSequencer) or [fLEXpx](https://github.com/Eden12345/fLEXpx).

When this library is finished, I will then refactor my JSequencer project so that it utilizes this instead of jQuery.
